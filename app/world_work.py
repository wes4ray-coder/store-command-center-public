"""THE COMPANY — Work-Priority scheduler (RimWorld-style).

The town is run by POLICY, not micro-management. Each agent has a priority for
every WORK TYPE (0 = never, 1 = highest … 4 = lowest). When an agent is free it
scans work types in priority order and takes the FIRST one that has an available
job right now — real department work, construction, research, or a gathering
skill, else it relaxes. This replaces the opaque `world_learn` bandit with a
player-legible control surface (the bandit survives as the optional "Auto" policy).

Columns are ordered left→right by default importance; the priority NUMBER dominates,
column order only breaks ties (RimWorld §2.3). Storage: world_work_priority.

"""Central registry of every LLM prompt/"bootstrap" the app uses.

One place to see and edit every system prompt. Each entry has a stable `key`, a
human `label`, a `category` (groups the Settings → Prompts tab), and a DEFAULT.
To avoid duplicating text, defaults that already live as module-level constants are
referenced lazily via `ref=(module, attr)`; a few prompts defined inline inside a
function carry their text here via `inline=`.

The LIVE value returned by `get_prompt(key)` is the settings override
(row `prompt__<key>` in the `settings` table, or a custom `settings_key`) when set,
otherwise the default. Call sites use `get_prompt(...)` instead of the raw constant —
that indirection is what makes every prompt editable from the UI, with zero behaviour
change until someone actually overrides one.

Import-safety: this module imports only `db` (which imports `config`), so there is no
cycle even though `deps` imports *this* module. `ref` targets are imported lazily at
call time, by which point every module is already loaded.

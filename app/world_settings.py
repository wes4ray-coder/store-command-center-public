"""
The Company — settings & real-world rules.

A thin, typed layer over the store's existing `settings` table (all keys prefixed
`world_`). Holds the LLM schedule (so the model runs on a cadence, not 24/7) and the
guardrails that keep agents realistic — no free items, price floors, sane discounts,
no auto-posting AI junk. Read via `get_all` / typed helpers; write via `save`.

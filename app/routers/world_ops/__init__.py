"""
The Company — God Console HTTP surface.

Thin endpoints over world_ops (budget ledger, prayers approval queue, community
messages, PayPal config). All under /api/world/ops/*.

This module is a package: the shared ``router``, the media→URL helpers and the
import-time executor registration live in ``_base``; the routes are split across
``budget`` (treasury/config), ``prayers`` (approval queue + gate toggles),
``community`` (messages + PayPal + board), ``control`` (automation + control plane
+ workboard) and ``republic`` (strategy engine + bible). Importing the submodules
runs their ``@router.*`` decorators, registering every route on the shared router.

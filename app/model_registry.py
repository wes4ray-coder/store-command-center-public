"""Central model registry — one place that names every model-using feature, its
description, and which model it's set to.

Powers Settings → 🧠 Models (pick a model per feature) and lets the unified queue
show which model each job runs. Every text/LLM feature ultimately funnels through
the orchestrator queue (the single GPU authority — see orchestrator.py), including
OpenClaw via the /api/llm proxy, so setting a model here is what the queue loads.

`kind` drives which option list the picker shows:
  llm    → text models on the node's LM Studio      (/api/settings/llm-models)
  vision → same list (a multimodal model)           (/api/settings/llm-models)
  image  → ComfyUI checkpoints                       (/api/models)
  lora   → free text  "file.safetensors:strength"   (no reliable listing)
A blank value means "use my fallback slot" (e.g. security → the global text LLM).

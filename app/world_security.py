"""THE COMPANY — general AI security (Phase-2 chunk 2).

Turns the Pi-hole-only security into a whole-store security desk: every large
subsystem has a LOG that gets scanned for trouble (failures, errors, stuck jobs),
every agent is assigned a BEAT (a system to watch) so there's always real work,
and when a raid fires a real scan runs — reviewing logs + Pi-hole activity — with
an actual MODEL review of anything suspicious submitted to the orchestrator queue
(so model work never fights image/video gen on the GPU).

Real analysis of real rows — no fabrication. Findings persist to security_findings
so they also become raid "bug" monsters (system D).

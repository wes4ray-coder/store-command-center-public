"""Dev Swarm engine — Phase 2.

Runs a proposed job through a state machine using LOCAL models only, one model in
VRAM at a time (every LLM turn goes through the orchestrator's single worker).

Hard safety boundaries:
  • All file edits happen in the **dev worktree** (config.REPO_DEV) — never master.
  • Scoped jobs (scope=file|folder) may only touch their listed paths.
  • Every applied change is committed to the `dev` branch → fully revertible.
  • Coders do FULL-FILE rewrites in a strict fenced format (reliable to parse from
    local models); unified diffs are not trusted.
  • Promotion dev→master→retail is a SEPARATE, user-approved step (routers/github.py).

State machine (swarm_jobs.status):
  proposed → planning → [awaiting_input] → coding → reviewing → testing
           → awaiting_review → (user approve) approved → (user promote) done
  reject/fail routes back to coding with feedback, or paused.

The driver advances stage-by-stage and stops at a gate determined by autonomy:
  gate  → stop at awaiting_input (questions) and awaiting_review (before promote)
  auto  → run straight through to awaiting_review (still user-approved)
  step  → stop after every stage (click Run to continue)

This package was split out of the former single-file `app/swarm.py`. It preserves the
exact public surface every external caller (and the prompt registry) relies on, so
`import swarm; swarm.<name>()` keeps resolving. Submodules are layered to avoid import
cycles:
  _base      ← (no intra-package deps)     state/config helpers
  llm        ← (no intra-package deps)     model roster/load/turn/parse
  workspace  ← (no intra-package deps)     git sandbox + file scoping
  systasks   ← _base, llm                  gated system-agent installs
  engine     ← _base, llm, workspace, systasks   stage machine + driver
The engine⇄systasks cycle (systasks.run_system_task resumes a job via start_job) is
broken by a lazy `from .engine import start_job` inside run_system_task.

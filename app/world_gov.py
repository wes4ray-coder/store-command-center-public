"""
The Company — voice & governance.

Everything the crew *says*: idle thoughts, business opinions, and the town meetings
where they vote the single top priority to fix next. Every LLM call is submitted to
the orchestrator queue via world_defs.run_llm_job (inside the submitted job we may
call the model directly — by then the orchestrator has arranged the GPU), so nothing
here ever collides with an image/video render. Meetings are pure CPU (no model).
